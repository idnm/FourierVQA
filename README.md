## Fourier expansion for variational quantum circuits
Prof-of-principle implementation of the algorithm for computing the Fourier series expansion of loss functions in variational algorithms algorithms, see
for the original paper https://arxiv.org/abs/??. Can handle a 50-qubit circuits with ~80 Pauli rotations (and more or less arbitrary Clifford gates) on a laptop in minutes, and a more efficient implementation can be expected to provide orders-of-magnitude speed-up. Notebook [ref] contains usage examples and numerical data presented in the paper.
