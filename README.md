## Fourier expansion of variational quantum circuits.
Prof-of-principle implementation of the algorithm computing the Fourier series expansion of loss functions in variational quantum algorithms, see
https://arxiv.org/abs/?? for the original paper. Can handle 50-qubit circuits with ~80 Pauli rotations (and more or less arbitrary Clifford gates) on a laptop in minutes, and a more efficient implementation can be expected to provide orders-of-magnitude speed-up. Notebook [ref] contains usage examples and numerical data presented in the paper.
